description: This skill should be used when the user asks to "compose email", "write email", "send email to", "new email", "send a message to", "email someone", "write to", "new message", "draft an email", "message someone", or wants to draft and send a new message. Composes emails with a two-phase safety gate that never auto-sends.
triggers:
  - compose email
  - write email
  - send email to
  - new email
  - send a message to
  - email someone
  - write to
  - new message

# /email:compose - Compose New Email

Write and send a new email (not a reply) with safety gates.

## Usage

```
/email:compose                           # Interactive compose
/email:compose to@example.com "Subject"  # Quick compose with recipient and subject
```

## When Invoked

1. Ask user for recipient, subject, and body (if not provided)
2. Call `compose_email` without `confirm` to generate a preview
3. Show the full preview to the user for review
4. Ask for feedback — user can edit recipients, subject, body, or approve
5. Only call `compose_email` with `confirm=true` after explicit user approval

**HTML emails:** When the body contains HTML content (auto-detected), the email is sent as multipart/alternative with both HTML and plain text parts, ensuring proper rendering in email clients. Set `html=true` to force HTML mode for HTML fragment bodies that wouldn't be auto-detected.

## Safety Rules

- NEVER send without explicit "yes" / "send it" / "looks good" from the user
- Always show the complete preview before sending
- If user says "change" or "edit", revise and show again
- Default to preview mode (confirm=false) on first pass

## Output Format

```
New Email Preview
To: alice@example.com
Subject: Meeting Request

Hi Alice,

I'd like to schedule a meeting to discuss the Q2 roadmap.
Would Thursday at 2pm work for you?

Best regards
